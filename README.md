# Mapping_Earthquakes
This analysis uses a MapBox API and Leaflet styled map layers to illustrate the relationship between the location and frequency of seismic activity and tectonic plates using GeoJSON data files. 

### GeoJSON Data Sources:
USGS Recorded Earthquakes (past 7 days)
- https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php

Tectonic Plate Boundaries
- https://github.com/fraxen

### Challenge

### Recommendation:
- Adjust the political world map to the earthquakes and tectonic plate data or wrap the data to the width of the map when zoomed out fully.
